similar one on Google and I didn’t find anything, I even spoke with some of my
friends about it and they didn’t mention anything that they were aware of
anything similar, so I got excited and started planning my efforts in developing
it, I even took a week of vacation from work to focus on that. The idea was a
time tracking app for developers, it would work by users installing a plugin
into their IDE and then the plugin would periodically upload the metrics to a
backend which would provide the users with dashboard and analytics. Some of you
might know that such a thing already exists and it’s
called &lt;a href="https://wakatime.com/dashboard"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Wakatime
&lt;/a>
, I didn’t
know that, and now that I’ve learned about it I’ve decided to scrap my project,
as this one does pretty much the same things as I had in mind, and the traction
behind it is pretty decent which would make it difficult for me to compete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is just another rock on a mountain of projects that I’ve thrown into
the bin, it’s quite an interesting situation that many developers have found
themselves in, maybe we all just have ADHD and only some of us manage to fight
it, although I understand the feeling of excitement when you run &lt;code>git init&lt;/code> and
it’s wonderful. Either way, after an initial disheartening and disappointing
feeling, I’m actually quite happy about the things I’ve learned in my few weeks
of half (or more like quarter) working on this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firstly and most obviously, I didn’t spend enough time searching for already
existing solutions. In hindsight, Wakatime was an obvious find, it’s not like
they didn’t do their SEO, but I just should have invested more of my time in
investigating rather then quickly jumping into development, especially
considering how much time I was planning to devote to that project. I did have
an inkling more investigation was needed, but maybe I didn’t want to find
anything because I was so happy with my idea and thought it would be a great
thing to work on. Next time, thought, more exploration before committing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Secondly, I’ve made it much more difficult then it should have been by using
stack that I wasn’t familiar with, my plan with the project was also to get back
to Golang a bit and to learn SvelteKit for the frontend, even though I also had
to learn IntelliJ plugin framework as well, and with all that I still planned my
time as if I was using a very familiar stack where I can find solutions quickly.
This was a big problem, because it was difficult to keep myself motivated when
there were so many unknowns in the development process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thirdly, I’ve learned a bit more about myself and what motivates me and how to
hack around that to achieve my goals more easily. Giving myself small tasks that
contribute to a big goal which I was tracking in a Notion board was a very
useful thing which kept me focused when I needed it. I’ve also invested time
into planning out my day in the morning, this is a more general advice, but it
worked great on this project as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There we go, even though the pile of dead projects has grown by one more, I’m
feeling good about the things I’ve learned so I’m still happy about it all in
general. Next project might fare a bit better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book review: Humble Pi by Matt Parker</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/book-review-humble-pi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/book-review-humble-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>I quite liked to book, it has a lot of interesting facts that I didn’t know
about, but it also had a lot of facts I already did know about especially
computing related. I’m not feeling particularly smug about that because those
that I did know I learned mostly from YouTube videos and some of those were by
Matt Parker anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Matt argues in the later parts of the book, humans are really good finding
ways around the safeguards that were put in place precisely to protect from the
kinds of mistakes we are about to do by avoiding them. I myself have done this
numerous of times, so thank the universe I’m not working on the kind of software
systems that concern people lives, because I’m certain there would be bodies
left behind by my short-sightedness. It is interesting though, that I do put a
lot of thought into setting systems in place to protect against human errors
usually, it’s just that I promptly go around those systems when it becomes a
slight inconvenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s intriguing to think about much more costly the mathematical and engineering
mistakes will become in the future, as we continue to further and further depend
on modern technological solutions for the modern technological world. Matt
points out multiple instances when mistakes cost lives due to, among others,
faulty medical equipment, poorly designed buildings or load baring
miscalculations, and we seem to be in a rush to help expand that list. Thinking
of everything Boeing related or so many car manufacturers issues recalls like
Tesla, GM, Toyota, Nissan and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Week 3: Picking up again</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/week-3-picking-up-again/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/week-3-picking-up-again/</guid><description>&lt;p>The third week picked up the pace a bit, the challenge was balancing it with
other things in my life, as I&amp;rsquo;ve recently also picked up running. There were a
few things I found myself doing that made it easier though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="knowing-what-will-be-the-first-thing-for-tomorrow">Knowing what will be the first thing for tomorrow

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This has worked nicely for me in the past as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s where I will
deliberately leave something unfinished, so that I know what I will be working
on
the next day. This has the added benefit of making it easier to start doing it
as you can just get straight into it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Back in my &lt;a href="https://martinovic.blog/posts/week-1-consistent-coding/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Week 1
&lt;/a>
I
mentioned that &amp;ldquo;There is no minimum size for the commit, simple documentation
changes are just fine&amp;rdquo;, and this has been a great hack for me, actually. I&amp;rsquo;ve
found that even the smallest changes, like fixing a typo, or adding a comment,
or even just a commit message, can be enough to get me into the flow of things,
and then I can continue working on something else.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Well this one is obvious, JIRA wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such an expensive piece of software
if having lists of things wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good productivity boost, but even for small
private projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that having a prioritised list of things to do is a
good way to keep myself on track and not get distracted by other things.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This week I was also spending quite a bit of time investigating ChatGPT and
other AI tools, there are a lot of legitimate usecases and I feel like we have
only just started to comprehend what we can do with them, but for my self, just
to start off, &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Open AI docs
&lt;/a>
have
been a pretty nice read. They&amp;rsquo;ve also recently unveiled
their &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Code interpreter
&lt;/a>
feature, which I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to trying out. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction
&lt;/a>
by Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner, which has been a pretty interesting read so far, it has heavy &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series"

fixing up the Zitadel demo I started, which, to be honest, was only broken
because I didn&amp;rsquo;t read the documentation properly. Ahh yes, the famous dilemma,
should I spend 3 hours with try different random things or should I spend 30
minutes reading the docs? I think we all know the answer to that one. RTFM, but
hey, at least I got to learn a bit more about the Zitadel API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up were some tiny changes to RSS feed on this bug, there was some Mastodon
about whether to keep the full content of the post in the feed or just the
summary, it ended up being that most people want the full thing, so I&amp;rsquo;ve added
that in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing I worked on was on the &lt;a href="https://payloadcms.com/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Payload
&lt;/a>
demo,
I&amp;rsquo;ve added a few collections and generated fixture or database see to make
development easier, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started adding some actually frontend to it, again,
based on &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"

NextJS
&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Ever since my role changed from a software engineer to a engineering manager,
I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding far less, my contributions were mostly in the form of code
reviews and the occasional bug fix, and this has fueled a feeling of longing to
actually write code again, to be able to create something from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;ve
been thinking about this for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and do something about
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-solution">The solution

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and do at least 1 commit every day, this is a small
experiment to see if I can get back into the habit of coding, and to see if I
can actually do it every day and to keep myself a bit more accountable, I&amp;rsquo;ll be
posting weekly updates on my blog here. This comes from the personal learnings
of the last few years that I have spent reading through various books. One of
the most influential ones
was &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Atomic Habits
&lt;/a>
by James Clear, which
I highly recommend, it&amp;rsquo;s a book that has a lot of actionable advice on how to
build habits and how to break bad ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This brings me to this little personal experiment and a few of the rules I&amp;rsquo;ve
set for myself:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>At least 1 commit every day&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is no minimum size for the commit, simple documentation changes are
just fine&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The commit can be in any project, personal or open source (here&amp;rsquo;s hopping I
can get myself involved more in open source)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It has mainly been about some demo projects utilising various new web
application development technologies, well not new per se, but certainly new to
me. These
were &lt;a href="https://nextjs.org/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
NextJS
&lt;/a>
, &lt;a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Tailwind CSS
&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://fly.io"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Fly.io
&lt;/a>
. Some CMSs like &lt;a href="https://strapi.io/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Strapi
&lt;/a>
and &lt;a href="https://payloadcms.com/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Payload
&lt;/a>
, which might or might not feed into
another project in the future. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been investigating a new auth
system &lt;a href="https://zitadel.com"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Zitadel
&lt;/a>
which is showing a lot of promise for a
small new startup. And I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated the Hugo
theme &lt;a href="https://github.com/TopHatCroat/izi-hugo-theme/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
izi
&lt;/a>
used by this blog by
doing some RSS bug fixes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it for this week, it&amp;rsquo;s not much but it&amp;rsquo;s honest work. Looking forward to

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you are in the top end of seniority in your team or company, either in
technical or domain aspects, chances are you will quickly understand the issue
or a new feature your team is presented with and you’ll also have a good clue on
how to approach it due to your technical knowledge or familiarity of the product
and the system. This is great and extremely valuable to the organisation, but
it’s not always beneficial to immediately share your insight with the team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the most fundamental mindset shifts when moving to a
leadership focused role and it’s often one of the most difficult ones, I know
it was for me. It is a great feeling to be the person with all the answers, the
dopamine hit of everyone listening and agreeing with you when you shoot a great
solution out immediately as you were presented with a problem is very addictive,
but it stops being productive rather quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your job now is to support and develop others, if you are always presenting
solutions, you are not doing that because others don’t have an opportunity to
learn and develop and because of this, I will go even as far as to say that
always presenting solutions is hurting the entire organisation in the long term.
What happens if you get hit by a bus or, more probably, go on a vacation for two
weeks? Will your team become paralysed? Will they be able to solve a crisis?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gets proportionally more important with high achievers who want to be
noticed and want to solve the big problems and if they don’t get the chance,
they will either leave, or worse, stop striving for more due to a lack of
motivation. Ask them directly how to solve a problem, it’s mutually beneficial,
and it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be genuine, not tricking others into a false sense
responsibility, it won&amp;rsquo;t work if you make a ceremony out of it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book commentary - Will Larson: Staff Engineer</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/staff-engineer-commentary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/staff-engineer-commentary/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve always found the job description of a staff engineer to be a particularly
compelling one, it requires a lot of technical, product and organisational
knowledge, but it also needs a set of hard and soft skills to actually utilise
this knowledge, without all of these combined the effect that can be achieved in
an organisation is only but a fraction of what is possible. Quite a challenging
set of requirements, from my point of view, so I wanted to get started on what
that means in reality which brought me to Will Larson’s Staff Engineer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="main-out-takes">Main out-takes
&lt;a href="#main-out-takes" class="anchor"> &lt;svg fill="#444444" width="16" height="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The author jumps directly into defining the different types of staff engineers
and how they operate, this was a good sign for me as it led me to think Larson
knows who the audience of this book are, it’s people who already have experience
in the field and are looking for what’s next. First part of the book goes over a
specific set of best practices for having the highest amount of meaningful
impact within the organisation, from aligning teams, defining problems and ways
to get to solutions, how to behave and position yourself within an organisation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something that I identify as a big thinking point for Larson was the
psychological impact of working with other people, throughout the book there are
strategically placed titbits that delve into human psychology and how we
cooperate; I find those to be particularly valuable and insightful, after all,
software development is there to solve problems for other humans, so
understanding both is an advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another big point I found is adaptability, no single person will always have all
the answers nor understand the nuances of the problem, sometimes we won’t agree
in what is the best path forward and that’s totally fine. Larson states that
leaders are not always at the helm, it is equally important to recognise when
sponsoring others is the better choice for the organisation and to do so
wholeheartedly. This is true for both your peers of equal or similar seniority,
but also for the more junior team members, since these are the people who will
one day inherit you, you want to teach them how to make decisions and be
independent, if this means sometimes letting them make mistakes, so be it, but
you need to give them space to grow, learn and be recognised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part of the book is a collection of interviews with different well
established people at staff engineer roles, I didn’t find much to be said about
this as these were in large part the inspiration for the knowledge described in
the first part, but it is useful and even calming to know that other people had
their share of difficulties and it would be more worrying if the path to a staff
engineer was smooth rather than intertwined with a fair bit of various
hardships.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>To conclude, one of the thoughts that stuck with me is that you should want to
alternate between leading and following, for the sake of the organisation, but
also for your own mental endurance and learning opportunities, you shouldn’t be
the person with all the answers and your role will more often than not be
facilitating the discovery of a solution with input from others which gets
increasingly more important as you organisation grows. The amount of small bits
of wisdom and references to other books and blogs makes this book also an
excellent guide to the staff engineer path over a longer period, it is certainly
a book I will keep coming back to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There are no dumb questions</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/no-dumb-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/no-dumb-questions/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="there-are-no-dumb-questions-only-dumb-answers">There are no dumb questions, only dumb answers

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Above is something I always repeat when someone starts a question with &amp;ldquo;This is
probably a dumb question, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.
The thought process behind it makes total sense: either a person doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to
waste the time of other people on the team or doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to look silly, so
they start with a nice cushion to fall back on in case somebody answers in a
condescending manner.
But in reality, this kind of interaction doesn&amp;rsquo;t help anyone.
Let me break down my reasoning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="asking-lots-of-questions-saves-time">Asking lots of questions saves time
&lt;a href="#asking-lots-of-questions-saves-time" class="anchor"> &lt;svg fill="#444444" width="16" height="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You know what&amp;rsquo;s much dumber than asking stupid questions? Carrying on with doing
something with an incorrect assumption from the beginning.
Many wise people have been heard quoting: &amp;ldquo;Assumption is the mother of all
fuck-ups&amp;rdquo;.
Making sure that requirements are well-defined and that you understand them
completely is always a good reason to ask yet another question.
This ensures that you are not wasting your own time, and then additionally, the
time needed for you or another person to notice the mistake and for the
corrections to be made.
Any mistake, in general, is much cheaper to fix time-wise before any
implementation work takes place, and it gets exponentially more expensive with
each stage, from QA to production.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>People are surprisingly adept at forgetting things, overlooking details and
jumping to conclusions, so sometimes the simplest of questions can make even the
most senior team members take a step back and reassess, or observe the problem
from another perspective and notice something new, maybe that an important piece
of information is missing or a technical debt that needs to be dealt with first
related to that shortcut we took in the previous sprint.
Most products are trying to solve difficult problems with edge cases and
indirect complexities, otherwise, those should instead be an Excel spreadsheet
with a few macros or a WordPress site.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Very often there is a lot of uncertainty when new features or products are
developed, by fostering clear and open communication through encouragement of
asking questions we can greatly reduce those uncertainties. When people feel
comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas they will be more likely to discuss
their work and seek assistance when needed, and you want this kind of
cooperation within a team.
Everyone can behave in this way, but it’s especially important for more senior
members as they should aim for their behaviour being what others look up to, and
if they are acting like a dismissive smartarses others will be afraid to speak
for fear of looking stupid.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Asking questions is good, regardless if you think it’s a small question or a big
question, especially as a more junior team member, you don’t understand the
whole domain enough to know how good the question is, and sometime the same
question will be asked multiple times, sometimes it’s just that complicated and
that’s fine (this is a good indication that it should be documented).
With that said, if you asked your colleague a question and they’ve invested time
and effort to answer you, then you should invest the effort to remember what was
said, or even better, write it down, because it can get irritating to be asked
the same question multiple times, it could be interpreted as disrespectful even.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I stopped learning</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/why-i-stopped-learning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/why-i-stopped-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>5 years ago when I finished university I was learning something new every day, I
was a software engineer and there was, what seemed to be an ocean of new shiny
technology I wanted to learn about, things that make the application run faster,
or UI look nicer, things that make the developer experience better.
I moved from one company to another always jumping into a more interesting
project, always being able to benefit from the things I’ve learnt before,
finding niche and not so niche areas to improve the new code and the product I
found myself working on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it worked for a while, and then I got an offer to lead a team of developers,
I took it, of course, because that’s what your next career step is, right?
Right?
No, it’s really not, but I didn’t know that at the time.
Anyway, this is a big change, we are not talking about another programming
language or another framework here, it’s a completely different set of skills,
and more importantly, values that I need to live now.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This clarity of knowing exactly what I need to learn next, which was in plain
sight at the start of one’s career, and sense of progress is exactly what
motivated me and helped me greatly in achieving learning goals.
However, when I moved into a more management focused role, it was the first time
in my life that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what to learn about next, I had very
little people experience and no idea of what I need to know about to become a
good team lead or engineering manager or however you like to call it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not having a well defined goal, makes every self-improvement attempt much less
effective and enjoyable, it starts making it feel like a chore, something you
have to do to achieve something, but you are not sure exactly what, or are you
even going in the right direction.
If this persists a person will slowly invest less and less time into learning,
probably the most evil thing about it is that it creeps in slowly, which makes
it hard to notice, it’s something to do with frogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What helped me realise that this was happening to me was that I found myself
struggling to focus, I would rarely get in the flow, and I started looking
forward to not doing anything on the weekend a bit more than before.
Don’t get me wrong, not doing anything over the weekend is amazing and I
recommend it wholeheartedly, but I knew that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t who I was every weekend.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Getting back on track is not an easy process and, much like it went away,
getting back takes time.
It requires self-reflection to identify the source of problem.
What often seems to be the case is that the cheese has been moved, as stated in
the famous
book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894.Who_Moved_My_Cheese"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Who Moved My Chese
&lt;/a>
,
and we don&amp;rsquo;t realise it.
This is what happened to me, it can come in different forms to each person, for
me it was that even though my job description changed by quite a bit, I did not
adapt my learning direction and just kept learning as if what I am doing is
still individual contribution, I saw that I needed to change that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Trying to optimise your learning path, like picking the best resources only, is
not something you should be overthinking, it’s a sort
of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
bin packing problem
&lt;/a>
,
but with time and it’s virtually impossible to have an optimal progression path.
What is important is that what you learn you can immediately try out, not only
will this ensure the lessons stick, but it will also give a huge motivation
boost to keep at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, what I changed was I realised the immense value of the new position
I found myself in being able to do much more with a team then I can do on my on,
in hindsight, I can’t believe I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it sooner.
Some take a more drastic approach, I know a person who quit a very well paid job
to instead spend a year learning ML and AI, simply because he was not feeling
motivated to work and he realised he didn’t want his whole life to feel like a
chore because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To conclude, if you are not feeling motivated to keep learning about whatever it
is you do, you need to change something, either your approach, or what you do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improvement days</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/improvement-days/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/improvement-days/</guid><description>&lt;p>Improvement day(s) is an event in which each team member is given a chance to
use the day(s) in whichever way they want, well as long as it’s something
productive, where are not here for improving Tekken or Rocket League skills on
the PlayStation.
What we are about here is different things like learning something new, trying
out a new library or tool and even hacking out a tiny proof of concept.
In the company I work at, we’ve been doing this for more than 2 years already,
and I’ve seen it become one of the things everybody is looking forward to, it
has helped in promoting innovation and creativity, learning and cooperation as
well as getting across the message that constant experimentation and improvement
is part of our culture, and we support it by having dedicated time for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-it-works">How it works?
&lt;a href="#how-it-works" class="anchor"> &lt;svg fill="#444444" width="16" height="16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-link-45deg" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The reasoning behind something like this is that we want to give everyone an
opportunity to do something completely different, without feeling pressure to
succeed, the only expectation is learning and sharing that knowledge with others
afterwards.
The process looks like this, everyone who wants to participate comes up with
ideas for improvement and writes them down in a public shared space, it
can be an idea that they want to work on or for someone else to take up.
Others can then give their input on the idea or even suggest that they join
forces and work on it together.
Then before we kick the improvement day(s) off, everyone participating gets
together and shares with others what they will be doing.
The end of this event is another meeting called “Improvement demo” where we
present the outcomes, however successful they may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to stress that it is completely OK not to participate, maybe
whatever the person is working on as part of daily business at the moment is
even more interesting, and also that it’s OK not
to achieve what was initially planned, it’s a very much a defining part of life
that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t always go according to the plan and that’s fine, this is an
opportunity to learn something from it, maybe that PoC wasn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as
originally thought, or, more often, the idea was a bit too ambitious from the
start.
This is one of the reasons why the initial meeting is there, it gives another
chance for more senior colleagues to add their suggestions and raise any
concerns.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the past I’ve seen some really awesome things come out of it like
improvements in the CI/CD pipeline, developer experience, web app loading time
reduction, ease of onboarding new team members, but also sometimes it shows the
benefits of doing things in a different and new way and this is then brought
into the regular sprint for any effort necessary to generally apply it.
There are also benefits that are not so visible, like facilitating discussion,
bouncing of ideas and generally advocating the spirit of always trying new
things with the aim of doing it better.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Improvement days are not about fixing technical debt or implementing purely
technical ideas that should otherwise be done as part of regular work, it should
not be used as a go to for all kinds of experimentation especially when those
are bigger things that can’t be done by a single person.
Another issue that is much more difficult to notice is that it could lead to
individuals feeling a bit unhappy after one or more of these which, in their
eyes, ended up as a “failure” because they did not achieve the goal, or if they
look at another’s “success” with a bit of an envious aftertaste.
I’ve put those words in quotes because at all times, whatever the end result is,
something has been learnt, and learning doesn&amp;rsquo;t always bring what we expect it
to.
So you might say, maybe better call it “Learning days”, but I don’t personally
like that because learning happens every day during usual work, not just on
certain days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I hope this post gave you an inspiration to try and push for something like this
at your own workplace.
The other companies that do something like this only do it with the engineering
department, but I feel like this is something that could be useful in other
departments as well since all have complex processes that could benefit from a
fresh new improvement, but I have yet to find instances where the company does
this more broadly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Try to take it easy</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/try-to-take-it-easy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/try-to-take-it-easy/</guid><description>&lt;p>I think that we all want to be good people who try to be nice and help others
even though the today’s world makes it seem like this is not the case.
I try to make others’ lives easier by being respectful of their time and not
asking for much of their attention because I know they are busy people with a
bunch of stuff on their minds.
But then I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself asking, why am I so often not giving the same
treatment to myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking out of my own previous experience, my plans and aspirations were very
ambitious, but I did not reach the goals that I’ve set for myself, I thought
it&amp;rsquo;s because I’m lazy, or because I’m not good enough, but that&amp;rsquo;s not it.
No one wants to work too much, and working too long tends to produce very
diminishing returns as the focus and effectiveness of my work slips, my
creativity suffers and, in my opinion, along with time, creativity my most
valuable resource as an individual.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What helped me arrive to this conclusion was what I read in a book
&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452796-drive"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
Drive by Daniel H. Pink
&lt;/a>
which talks about motivation and how to create an environment that nurtures it,
mostly from an organisation’s perspective, but it can be applied to leading
ourselves as well.
It&amp;rsquo;s an excellent and concise book which I wholeheartedly recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As much as we would like to be incredibly efficient and productive, humans are
simply not, and the solution is definitely not to push are selves to the point
of burning out, you are not a lesser person for allowing yourself to take it a
bit easier.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started reducing the amount of things on my plate and I think you
should consider it as well. There are real benefits to taking the time to rest,
recharge and refocus and there are others
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/06/how-slowing-down-at-work-can-help-you-get-more-done.html"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
who agree with this
&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean reducing my ultimate aspirations or accepting that
I will not achieve what I want, on the contrary, this means to actually allow
myself to focus on the few things I have happening in my life currently so that
I ensure I give it my full attention and, more importantly, finish those things
before moving on to the next one (or quitting because I realise I don&amp;rsquo;t actually
want it that much, but don&amp;rsquo;t use it as an excuse).
It is even not counter-intuitive once I understood that one of the biggest time
wasters I have, and I have more than enough of those, is the constant context
switching that just disappears when there is fewer things going on at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a bazillion of people wrote and talked about this topic on the
internet, good and bad (like this blog post)that there is a lot of other
resources you can find on how taking a lighter approach ultimately allows us to
achieve bigger results.
If you want to see more of it I recommend this excellent talk with plenty of
other good
ideas: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FS1mnISoG7U"

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="w"> &lt;/span>- &lt;span class="nt">run&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="w"> &lt;/span>&lt;span class="l">echo &amp;#34;this is the build job&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="w">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>First thing to do is to add the Elasticsearch image (&lt;code>#1&lt;/code>)to your test image on
Circle CI. Circle CI will use the
first &lt;code>- image&lt;/code> in &lt;code>docker&lt;/code> YAML array as a starter image, and every
following &lt;code>- image&lt;/code> item will be &amp;ldquo;joined&amp;rdquo; into the
first image with their ports exposed on localhost.
So in our case, as stated in &lt;code>#2-4&lt;/code>, Elasticsearch will start
at &lt;code>localhost:9200&lt;/code> and that&amp;rsquo;s where it will be available
within your tests running on Circle CI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up is setting the name of the cluster (&lt;code>#5&lt;/code>), any name will do, use
something that is relevant to you.
Setting discovery type to &lt;em>singe-node&lt;/em> in &lt;code>#6&lt;/code> is required to make Elasticsearch
work when only one instance is running,
which is true in our case as we only want a bare bones Elasticsearch cluster to
test on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>#7&lt;/code> is up to you, it disables security features which you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need
on your testing environment, so this just
makes things easy, but feel free to enable them if you want to make sure your
code runs only on properly secured ES.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Circle CI has limits on how much memory your images can use, with &lt;em>medium&lt;/em>
resource class, which is the default, this is
4 GB, so you want to be pretty frugal with memory here.
But you might already be aware of this if you ever saw the dreaded &lt;code>error 137&lt;/code>.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that 256 MB is enough for Elasticsearch to do all I need it to do
during testing, much less than that and you
start seeing errors during ES start up, you might need more if you are testing
some serious workflows with ES, so adjust
accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, ES takes some time to start up, so in &lt;code>#9&lt;/code> we use &lt;em>dockerize&lt;/em> to await
the start up of it, because it would be
possible for your tests to start befor ES is ready.
&lt;em>dockerize&lt;/em> comes preinstalled in standard CircleCI base images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it, happy testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merge Two History tables</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/merge-history-table-migration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/merge-history-table-migration/</guid><description>&lt;p>History tables hold the past state of an entity by saving all the values of the
original entity along with a date and time range field that specify when these
values were valid, I will refer to this field as &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;validity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>.
This pattern is used when you need to remember the changes an entity went
through over time, it is often used with, for example, pricing data, so that you
can track changes of some price as time passes.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At the company I currently work at we wanted to reduce unnecessary complexity
that got introduced as our business case evolved, this required merging two
tables into a single one, which also required to to merge their corresponding
history tables as well. These two history tables have different periods of
validity, as they&amp;rsquo;ve been changed at different times in history, so the merged
history table must properly reflect changes in both tables.
This is a bit difficult to explain with words so here&amp;rsquo;s a graph.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets say that we have a &lt;code>products&lt;/code> table (&lt;code>A&lt;/code>) and a &lt;code>pricing&lt;/code> table (&lt;code>B&lt;/code>) and
the final result we are looking for after the migration is to merge these two
into a single &lt;code>AB&lt;/code> table.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> A1------------A2-----
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> B1-------------
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> AB1---AB2-----AB3----
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>At &lt;code>A1&lt;/code> point in time we created our product, then at &lt;code>B1&lt;/code> we created our price
and assigned it to the product &lt;code>A&lt;/code>, then a bit later we updated the product
at &lt;code>A2&lt;/code>.
After migration, our history table should have show all values from &lt;code>A&lt;/code> with
null fields that belong to values &lt;code>B&lt;/code> since it has not been created yet, and
validity filed holding &lt;code>[A1, infinity)&lt;/code>.
Then, once &lt;code>B&lt;/code> is created at &lt;code>B1&lt;/code> the new history entity should have all values
from &lt;code>A&lt;/code> and &lt;code>B&lt;/code> and validity field holding &lt;code>[B1, infinity)&lt;/code> as well as update
the previous validity field with &lt;code>[A1, B1)&lt;/code> meaning this history entity is now
only valid in between times &lt;code>A1&lt;/code> and &lt;code>B1&lt;/code> or &lt;code>AB1&lt;/code> and &lt;code>AB2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you want to keep the name of one of the older tables and merge the data of
the other history table into it, the simplest way to achieve this is to create
a
new history table anyway, and afterwards delete the old table and rename the
new
one.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>When I first thought about how to do this, I imagined the solution will be much
more trouble, but as I played around with test data, it turned out to be quite a
simple one to do.
If you want to play around with this, you can

work you do and distribute it easily on other computers.
But over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that a lot of my workflow depends on various
configurations and helper scripts I have in my path.
So why not version those as well, it does allow you to get started in seconds in
a very familiar environment on every new computer or even a server if you spend
a lot of your time in SSH sessions.
Bonus points for making it a public repository so others can take a look at your
stuff and possibly get inspiration for improvements in their workflow, just make
sure you don&amp;rsquo;t commit any private keys.&lt;/p>

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Feel free to check out my home repository
over &lt;a href="https://github.com/tophatcroat/home"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
here
&lt;/a>
. As you can see, it contains
my &lt;code>.zshrc&lt;/code>, &lt;code>.vimrc&lt;/code> a &lt;code>bin&lt;/code> directory with various scripts, dotfiles and some
other stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve curated while doing what I do best, fidgeting around a
computer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can start your own version by simply initializing a Git repository in your
home directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nb">cd&lt;/span> ~ &lt;span class="o">&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span> git init
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now your directory will be full of stuff you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to commit, like
your downloads, pictures, private keys, shell history or what have you.
So it&amp;rsquo;s important to set up the &lt;code>~/.gitignore&lt;/code> file immediately to stop you from
accidentally committing stuff you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most importantly, you should ignore everything by default in
your &lt;code>~/.gitignore&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Blacklist all in this folder&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/*
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Except for these&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">!.gitignore
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">!.gitconfig
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">!.notes/
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">!bin/
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">!Development/Sh
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will instruct Git to keep its hands off all files except for
the &lt;code>.gitignore&lt;/code>, &lt;code>.gitconfig&lt;/code> and the files in the &lt;code>.notes&lt;/code>, &lt;code>bin&lt;/code>
and &lt;code>Development/Sh&lt;/code> directories.
So now, when you want to add any other file or directory you will require a
force flag like so&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git add -f path_to_file
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s basically all you need to do to set this up, it&amp;rsquo;s now up to you to
add and commit all you want and push it to the Git hosting service of your
choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-cloning">The cloning

&lt;/svg> &lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So now it&amp;rsquo;s time to clone this into your new home directory, but if you try
cloning it using &lt;code>git clone&lt;/code> command it will complain that it can&amp;rsquo;t do that in
an non empty directory.
To get around this, you need to initialize it first then manually add the remote
and finally force a checkout like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nb">cd&lt;/span> ~
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Create an empty git repository in your home folder&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git init
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Add the remote&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git remote add origin https://github.com/TopHatCroat/home
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Get the stuff from up there&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git fetch
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1"># Be careful! This will overwrite any local files existing on remote!&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git reset --hard origin/master
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Running the last command will basically checkout all the files from the origin
master branch and overwrite any files with the same path, so be careful if you
already did some setup on the new machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it, you&amp;rsquo;ve saved yourself the bother of copying over the config
files.
The only thing that remains is to install the tools that use the configs you&amp;rsquo;ve
just brought over.
If you are feeling adventurous you could make a script that will do that for you
like I did
in &lt;a href="https://github.com/TopHatCroat/home/blob/master/Development/Sh/setup.sh"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
here
&lt;/a>
,
but that is up to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>EDIT:&lt;/em> As a response to this blog post others have pointed
out &lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
another viable solution
&lt;/a>
,
or by using &lt;a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/gnu-stow-dotfiles/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
GNU stow
&lt;/a>
,
or &lt;a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick"

homesick
&lt;/a>
or &lt;a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm"

rcm
&lt;/a>
.
Still, the solution presented here is the simplest to setup and understand and
it does not depend on any other tool besides Git.
All in all, there are a bunch of ways to do this and a lot more resources are
available &lt;a href="https://dotfiles.github.io/"

&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been using KDE Connect Android application for a while now due to its
great integration KDE Plasma desktop.
It allows you to send files over, share your clipboard, sync notifications and
has other useful features like remote control using the phones screen as a
touchpad or keyboard on your computer which is greatly appreciated feature for
when you just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be asked to reach for your mouse to select the next
YouTube video to play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One feature which requires a bit of effort to get the most of it are commands.
KDE Connect gives you an option to add named shortcuts for arbitrary commands to
run on your computer from your phone!
The simplest example of this would be to have a shortcut named &amp;ldquo;Suspend&amp;rdquo; and a
command which states &lt;code>systemctl suspend&lt;/code>.
You guessed it, it would put the computer to sleep.
So, as you can imagine, this is quite a powerful feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of the commands that I use:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">PC Suspend:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">systemctl &lt;span class="nb">suspend&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">PC Lock:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">PC Shutdown:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">systemctl poweroff
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Volume Up:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">qdbus org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kmix invokeShortcut &lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;increase_volume&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Volume Down:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">qdbus org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kmix invokeShortcut &lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;decrease_volume&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Volume Mute:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">qdbus org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kmix invokeShortcut &lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;mute&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Screenshot Fullscreen:

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Bluetooth On:

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tip:&lt;/strong> KDE Connect Android client sorts these commands alphabeticaly, so you
can keep then grouped by starting them with the same text&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In case you are wondering from where did I get these beautifully long commands,
you can find them yourself using &lt;em>qdbus&lt;/em> or if you prefer GUI tools then there
is &lt;em>qdbusviewer&lt;/em>.
To be fair, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to use the GUI tool if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you are
looking for because these commands sometimes well hidden or duplicated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, these are &lt;a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener">
DBus
&lt;/a>
commands, &lt;em>DBus&lt;/em> is a software serial bus used to send messages from one
application to another.
Obviously, some of these commands are specific to KDE, so you would need to dig
in to find their counterparts for Gnome or any other DE, but if you do, please
do leave them in comments for others to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello world</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/helloworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/helloworld/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="well-hello-there">Well, hello there
