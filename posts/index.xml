I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and do something about it.</description></item><item><title>Don't present solutions, present problems</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/dont-present-problems-present-solutions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/dont-present-problems-present-solutions/</guid><description>The biggest challenge with new leaders is letting go If you are in the top end of seniority in your team or company, either in technical or domain aspects, chances are you will quickly understand the issue or a new feature your team is presented with and you’ll also have a good clue on how to approach it due to your technical knowledge or familiarity of the product and the system.</description></item><item><title>Book commentary - Will Larson: Staff Engineer</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/staff-engineer-commentary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/staff-engineer-commentary/</guid><description>I’ve always found the job description of a staff engineer to be a particularly compelling one, it requires a lot of technical, product and organisational knowledge, but it also needs a set of hard and soft skills to actually utilise this knowledge, without all of these combined the effect that can be achieved in an organisation is only but a fraction of what is possible. Quite a challenging set of requirements, from my point of view, so I wanted to get started on what that means in reality which brought me to Will Larson’s Staff Engineer.</description></item><item><title>There are no dumb questions</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/no-dumb-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/no-dumb-questions/</guid><description>There are no dumb questions, only dumb answers Above is something I always repeat when someone starts a question with &amp;ldquo;This is probably a dumb question, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. The thought process behind it makes total sense: either a person doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to waste the time of other people on the team or doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to look silly, so they start with a nice cushion to fall back on in case somebody answers in a condescending manner.</description></item><item><title>Why I stopped learning</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/why-i-stopped-learning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/why-i-stopped-learning/</guid><description>5 years ago when I finished university I was learning something new every day, I was a software engineer and there was, what seemed to be an ocean of new shiny technology I wanted to learn about, things that make the application run faster, or UI look nicer, things that make the developer experience better. I moved from one company to another always jumping into a more interesting project, always being able to benefit from the things I’ve learnt before, finding niche and not so niche areas to improve the new code and the product I found myself working on.</description></item><item><title>Improvement days</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/improvement-days/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/improvement-days/</guid><description>Improvement day(s) is an event in which each team member is given a chance to use the day(s) in whichever way they want, well as long as it’s something productive, where are not here for improving Tekken or Rocket League skills on the PlayStation. What we are about here is different things like learning something new, trying out a new library or tool and even hacking out a tiny proof of concept.</description></item><item><title>Try to take it easy</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/try-to-take-it-easy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/try-to-take-it-easy/</guid><description>I think that we all want to be good people who try to be nice and help others even though the today’s world makes it seem like this is not the case. I try to make others’ lives easier by being respectful of their time and not asking for much of their attention because I know they are busy people with a bunch of stuff on their minds. But then I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself asking, why am I so often not giving the same treatment to myself.</description></item><item><title>Setup Elasticsearch on CircleCI</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/circle-ci-elasticsearh/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/circle-ci-elasticsearh/</guid><description>This is going to be a short one I&amp;rsquo;m only writing this one because I could not Google exactly what I needed as easily as I expected, so hopefully it might help someone. Setting up an Elasticsearch instance to test against on CircleCI is actually quite straightforward.
Your .circleci/config.yml should look something like this:
jobs: build: docker: - image: circleci/&amp;lt;language&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;version TAG&amp;gt; - image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.12.0 #1 environment: - transport.host: localhost #2 - network.</description></item><item><title>Merge Two History tables</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/merge-history-table-migration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/merge-history-table-migration/</guid><description>History tables hold the past state of an entity by saving all the values of the original entity along with a date and time range field that specify when these values were valid, I will refer to this field as &amp;ldquo;validity&amp;rdquo;. This pattern is used when you need to remember the changes an entity went through over time, it is often used with, for example, pricing data, so that you can track changes of some price as time passes.</description></item><item><title>Home .git</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/home-git/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/home-git/</guid><description>Git is an incredibly useful tool for a programmer, you use it to version the work you do and distribute it easily on other computers. But over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that a lot of my workflow depends on various configurations and helper scripts I have in my path. So why not version those as well, it does allow you to get started in seconds in a very familiar environment on every new computer or even a server if you spend a lot of your time in SSH sessions.</description></item><item><title>KDE Connect commands</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/kdeconnect-commands/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/kdeconnect-commands/</guid><description>KDE Connect useful commands So I&amp;rsquo;ve been using KDE Connect Android application for a while now due to its great integration KDE Plasma desktop. It allows you to send files over, share your clipboard, sync notifications and has other useful features like remote control using the phones screen as a touchpad or keyboard on your computer which is greatly appreciated feature for when you just couldn&amp;rsquo;t be asked to reach for your mouse to select the next YouTube video to play.</description></item><item><title>Hello world</title><link>https://martinovic.blog/posts/helloworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>martinovic.antonio@gmail.com (Antonio Martinović)</author><guid>https://martinovic.blog/posts/helloworld/</guid><description>Well, hello there Welcome to my blog, this is going to be a place for me to share what and how I use in my work and at home. Stuff like mini tutorials, random rants and TILs of programming.
Stay tuned!</description></item></channel></rss>
