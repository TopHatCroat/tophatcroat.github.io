      <description>I think that we all want to be good people who try to be nice and help others even though the today’s world makes it seem like this is not the case. We try to make others’ lives easier by being respectful of their time and not asking for much of their attention because we know they are busy people with a bunch of stuff on their minds. Then why are we so often not giving the same treatment to ourselves.</description>
