      <description>Git is an incredibly useful tool for a programmer, you use it to version the work you do and distribute it easily on other computers. But over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that a lot of my workflow depends on various configurations and helper scripts I have in my path. So why not version those as well, it does allow you to get started in seconds in a very familiar environment on every new computer or even a server if you spend a lot of your time in SSH sessions.</description>
