<p>I have been programming and developing applications for over 9 years now, with 4 years of
professional experience. I have a constant will to learn new skills and technologies in the field
of application development, computer networks and security. In my free time I love to build
and fly FPV racing drones, listen to music and philosophize.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>

<p>Lately I got a chance to work as a full stack engineer which included Kotlin and NodeJS
backend development with Spring Boot and ExpressJS, for the web and mobile clients I&rsquo;ve
worked with React and  React Native technologies. I&rsquo;ve also been developing my Dev Ops
skills with Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Jenkins and CircleCI which taught me to
appreciate the advantages of TDD and CI/CD. Previously, I&rsquo;ve acquired more than 4 years
of Android experience in Java and Kotlin using different software architectures such as
MVP and MVVM, leveraging functional paradigms with the help of Rx libraries. During my
work I have learned how to use different dialects of SQL (mostly PostgreSQL) and I have
also used NoSQL database systems such as MongoDB and Elastisearch. I have a very good
understanding of GNU/Linux and I use it as my daily driver.</p>

<p>Besides the technical skills I&rsquo;m confident in my human skills as well, as I&rsquo;ve have had
the chance to work in very diverse and capable teams and been able to communicate through
the requirements and problems with my colleagues and the clients in English and Croatian.</p>
